File upload vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows attackers to upload malicious files without proper validation. On Windows systems, these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, defacement, or data breaches.

## How File Upload Vulnerabilities Work

Typically, attackers upload scripts like `.aspx`, `.php`, or `.exe` files disguised as harmless files. If the server executes these files, attackers gain control over the system.

## Common Exploitation Techniques

- Uploading web shells (e.g., ASPX shell for IIS servers)
- Bypassing file extension checks using double extensions (e.g., `file.php.jpg`)
- Using null byte injection in legacy systems

## Mitigations

- Strict file type validation
- Storing uploads outside webroot
- Disabling script execution in upload directories
- Using antivirus scanning on uploads

File upload vulnerabilities remain a critical attack vector on Windows web servers and should be thoroughly tested during penetration testing.
